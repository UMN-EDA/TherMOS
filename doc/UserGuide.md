# Thermal model for planar bulk, SOI MOSFETs and NCFETs
This thermal model is constructed to measure the rise in temperature due to self-heating in planar bulk, SOI, and NCFET devices. The software models an equivalent resistor stack from scratch given the dimensions of each componenet in the device along with the thermal conductivities of each material within the device. The rise in temperature is estimated by solving the second order partial difference heat equation using the finite difference method.
