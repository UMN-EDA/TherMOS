# TherMOS: Output Directory

This directory contanisthe outputs generated by TherMOS. It includes the
following files:
+ T.out: A matrix representation of the temperature at every node in the
  simulation.
+ temperature_profile.png: The graphic for the termperature distribution across
  the simulation space.
+ temperature.rpt: A reprt which states the maximum temperature rise, average,
  and minimum temperature rise in the device due to self-heating.
