# TherMOS: Scripts Directory

This directory has the octave scripts that are used to visualize the
temperature distribution graphics. There are two Octave scripts in this
directory: 

- visualize_T.m: Octave script that generates the temperature contour plot for the
structure.
- visualize_C.m: Octave script that generates the thermal conductivity plot for
each material in the structure.

These are optional scripts for visualization purposes only.
