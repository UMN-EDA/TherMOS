# TherMOS: Temporary work directory

This directory is the scratch or work directory. This contains three files
generated by TherMOS that are needed by Octave to plot the temperature contour plot.

- device_parameters.csv: This file has the dimensions of the structure, i.e., the total length, width, height of the three dimensional structure for visualization in Octave. 
- T.out: Temperature matrix
- C.out: Thermal conductivity matrix
